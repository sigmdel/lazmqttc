# lazmqttc: Lazarus MQTT Client

A basic MQTT client written in Free Pascal/Lazarus. It uses the libmosquitto library to communicate with the MQTT broker.

The screen capture shows the message sent to the public `test.moquitto.org` broker 
and it's reply. 

## Requirements

The libmosquito library is needed. In Debian systems this means installing two packages:
-  libmosquitto1    
-  libmosquitto-dev 

The first, `libmosquitto1` will probably already be installed if the mosquitto-clients package is available on the system. In Debian based systemsI these packages can be installed with a package manager such as [Synaptic](http://www.nongnu.org/synaptic/) or from the command line.

    $ sudo apt install libmosquitto1 libmosquitto-dev

Two Free Pascal units are required

- mosquitto.pas - conversion of the C mosquitto.h header to Pascal, provides the same API as the C version
- mqttclass.pas - Object Pascal wrapper class to ease the integration of libmosquitto into Object Oriented 

These files, found in the [mosquitto-p](mosquitto-p/) directory, are copied from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chainq/mosquitto-p) with the same name by KÃ¡roly Balogh (chainq).

## Testing Environment

The project was built with Lazarus 2.0.12 (Free Pascall 3.2.0) on a Mint 20.1 system with version 1.6.9-1 of the mosquitto libraries. 

This utility was cobbled quickly to fulfill an immediate need: wrangling a number of IoT devices running Tasmota firmware. The code could use considerable improvement.

# Installation

To install the compiled executable in Mint 20.1 (MATE), 

1. Copy it to a directory in the search path such as `~/.local/bin`.
2. Copy the image `lazmqttc.png` from the `images` directory in the source tree to the same directory.
3. Copy the `lazmqtt.desktop` file to '~/.local/share/applications'.

Adjust the content of the desktop file if the executable is renamed or if it is placed in a different directory. 

If need be, see [Desktop Entry Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/index.html) and  Annexe [A. Registered Categories](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/menu-spec-1.0.html#category-registry) to change the category or categories under which the executable will appear in the menu.
